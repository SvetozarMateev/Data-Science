Your homework consists of two parts:
1. As usual, you will need to finish the labs and exercises in class. If you've got
   any questions, don't be afraid to ask in the forum or shoot me an email.
* 2. Load the Jupyter Notebook in your environment and read it. Try to get acquainted
   with the methods and the way of working in general. You're free to skip this part
   but it will give you some real-world knowledge and examples how to organize your
   research. After running the notebook, if you have time and desire, try implementing
   some (or all) tasks at the end.
